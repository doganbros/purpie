    "text1": "Pavilion is an open-source social-media platform and a content creation tool rolled into one. You can create meetings, upload videos, share and record your video content, all through Pavilion. It is created by the team behind Doganbros and their over 20 years of experience in the field of multi-media delivery.",
    "text2": "About 8 years ago, two brothers joined together to create Doganbros, with a vision to create a software workshop, combining the personal feel of freelance developers and the professionalism of large outsourcing companies.",
    "text3": "While they worked on the projects they took under, the idea for a platform combining their talents started to form. A toolbox for content creators, where they start, record and publish their live feeds or upload videos. A flexible hub they can either make use of directly, or connect with an API. With tools to aid publishing and monetizing their creation. This idea became Pavilion"
